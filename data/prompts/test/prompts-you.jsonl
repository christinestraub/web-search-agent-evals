It should also mention at least one Vertex AI–specific aspect (such as using Vertex AI Studio, Generative AI “bounding box detection” APIs, or AutoML/Vertex AI Vision evaluation metrics like IoU or mean average precision) to show awareness of the 2026 Vertex AI tooling context.[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]]"}
